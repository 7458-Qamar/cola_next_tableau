An interactive Tableau dashboard built to analyze the complete sales and operations performance of ColaNext.  
It brings together customers, orders, products, suppliers, stock, employees, and payment methods in one place so decision makers can quickly understand what is happening in the business.

- How many customers, employees, and suppliers do we have
- Which products and categories are driving the most profit

All views are interactive and can be filtered by position, payment method, and other dimensions.
